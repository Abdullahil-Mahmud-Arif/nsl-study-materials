## Week#03
## Projects - 1
- [Create Breakout game using python](https://www.101computing.net/breakout-tutorial-using-pygame-getting-started/)

![Break out game](https://github.com/NSLabTeam/data-structure-algorithm/blob/master/break-out-game.png)
## Week#04
## Projects - 2
Convert the `project - 1` as shooter game.
Game should have following feature
- You can shoot the brick
- Bricks are moveable towords down

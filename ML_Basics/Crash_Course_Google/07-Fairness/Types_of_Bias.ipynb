    "`Reporting bias`occurs when the frequency of events, properties, and/or outcomes captured in a data set does not accurately reflect their real-world frequency. This bias can arise because people tend to focus on documenting circumstances that are unusual or especially memorable, assuming that the ordinary can \"go without saying.\"\n",

    "### Example:\n",
    "A model trained to predict different types of Bananas from images. Unlike Green or Brown Bananas Yellow Bananas are just labeled as Banana because Yellow goes without saying."

    "A model is trained to predict future sales of a new product based on phone surveys conducted with a sample of consumers who bought the product.

    "A model is trained to predict future sales of a new product based on phone surveys conducted with a sample of consumers who bought the product and with a sample of consumers who bought a competing product.

    "A model is trained to predict future sales of a new product based on phone surveys conducted with a sample of consumers who bought the product and with a sample of consumers who bought a competing product. Instead of randomly targeting consumers, the surveyer chose the first 200 consumers that responded to an email, who might have been more enthusiastic about the product than average purchasers."
